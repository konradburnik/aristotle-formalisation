I defined a table as a list of rows and the `SELECT COUNT(*)` query as the length of that list. I then proved that the query does not always return a positive number by showing that an empty table results in a count of 0, which is not positive. This serves as the requested counterexample.

A table is a list of rows of type α.
-/
def Table (α : Type) := List α

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table returns the number of rows.

def select_count (α : Type) (t : Table α) : Nat := t.length

It is not the case that the query always returns a positive number (counterexample exists).
